🚀 DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

1️⃣ UI/UX PLANNING & ARCHITECTURE

🎨 Before development, the UI/UX design was carefully planned to ensure an intuitive and smooth user experience. The system architecture was structured to define seamless component interactions.

2️⃣ BACKEND DEVELOPMENT (SPRING BOOT & JAVA 17)

Once the architecture was finalized, backend development began with the definition of key entities:

📝 Task – Represents the user's tasks.
👤 User – Manages authentication and task ownership.

📌 Controllers & Service Logic:
Controllers and service layers were implemented to handle business logic, process data, and manage requests efficiently.

3️⃣ CHALLENGES FACED & SOLUTIONS

🔐 Password Encryption
To secure user credentials, AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) was implemented after extensive research on encryption techniques.

🔄 Database Relationships
One-to-Many & Many-to-One mappings in Spring Boot & JPA were implemented, overcoming complexity in entity relationships.

4️⃣ API TESTING & FRONTEND INTEGRATION

Since the frontend was under development, APIs were tested using Postman to verify all endpoints. Once validated, they were integrated into the React.js frontend for a seamless user experience.

This structured approach ensured a smooth, secure, and efficient development process! 🚀

🎨 FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT (REACT.JS)

Once the backend was successfully tested using Postman, the focus shifted to frontend development using React.js.

🔹 FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

✅ Add Tasks: Create and manage tasks effortlessly.
✅ Edit Tasks: Modify existing tasks using an intuitive pencil icon.
✅ Delete Tasks: Remove tasks when no longer needed.
✅ Filter Tasks: Keep track of tasks using filtering options for better organization.

🔹 CHALLENGES FACED & SOLUTIONS

⚠️ CORS Issues
Difficulties with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) were encountered when integrating the frontend with the backend. This was resolved by configuring appropriate CORS policies in Spring Boot.

🎨 Enhancing Tiny Features
Worked on refining UI/UX elements to improve user interaction and overall experience.
