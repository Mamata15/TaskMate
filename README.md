Development Process

1️⃣ UI/UX Planning & Architecture

🎨 Before development, the UI/UX design was carefully planned to ensure an intuitive and smooth user experience. The system architecture was structured to define seamless component interactions.

2️⃣ Backend Development (Spring Boot & Java 17)

Once the architecture was finalized, backend development began with the definition of key entities:

Task – Represents the user's tasks.

User – Manages authentication and task ownership.

Controllers & Service Logic:

Controllers and service layers were implemented to handle business logic, process data, and manage requests efficiently.

3️⃣ Challenges Faced & Solutions

🔐 Password Encryption

To secure user credentials, AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) was implemented after extensive research on encryption techniques.

🔄 Database Relationships

One-to-Many & Many-to-One mappings in Spring Boot & JPA were implemented, overcoming complexity in entity relationships.

4️⃣ API Testing & Frontend Integration

Since the frontend was under development, APIs were tested using Postman to verify all endpoints. Once validated, they were integrated into the React.js frontend for a seamless user experience.

This structured approach ensured a smooth, secure, and efficient development process! 🚀

Frontend Development (React.js)

Once the backend was successfully tested using Postman, the focus shifted to frontend development using React.js.

Features Implemented

Add Tasks: Create and manage tasks effortlessly.

Edit Tasks: Modify existing tasks using an intuitive pencil icon.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks when no longer needed.

Filter Tasks: Keep track of tasks using filtering options for better organization.

Challenges Faced & Solutions

⚠️ CORS Issues

Difficulties with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) were encountered when integrating the frontend with the backend. This was resolved by configuring appropriate CORS policies in Spring Boot.

🎨 Enhancing Tiny Features

Worked on refining UI/UX elements to improve user interaction and overall experience.
